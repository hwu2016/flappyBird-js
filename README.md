# flappyBird-js
A Javascript and HTML5 canvas based "Flappy Bird" game, modified from @Code Explained. The original link is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L07i4g-zhDA  
Major features:
+ Add a game start scene
+ Add hard mode - faster and harder!
+ Add a gameover scene to avoid instant game reloading
+ Bird is now accelarating rather than falling in a constant speed - smoother
+ Fixed an audio issue that flying sound cannot be played until the former one ends
